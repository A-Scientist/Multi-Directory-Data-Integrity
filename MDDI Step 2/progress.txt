added some changes that needed to be made becuase i am now doing some editing on linux. one of my lines requires
that I ask for a directory and linux and windows use different slashes in their directory names, so i had to compensate for that.
Also, I have decided to use command line git on linux and desktop git on windows so i get practive with both.

Uploaded the repo to git rather than the "repo" in onedrive and made sure i can run python in VScode linux. Seeing as how part of my goals was to practice and get familiar with git, this is actually an important step.

wow, here i am again
progress: made it so that it can make a script file or decide not to if one with that name already exists
it can now make a list of scripts it found or has created recently
made a bunch of TODOs so i know what to do next time

i am, once again, not sure where to start, not good for promising i will start it soon
althought typing this is something i think
let me re-run myself over the premise of the project

an application that takes in three or more file backup locations and saves them to a perminant memory location (like a file)

it also takes a time scale (it can be pure seconds for the time being) for when it checks data and records that as well

it makes sure all but one of them are empty and that one has content, else it raises a warning that it cannot continue

if you continue, it copies the content of the full one into the empty ones

it then makes all non main directories read only

the interface changes to one that allows the user to change the check time and update all from the main once a change has been deliberately made, as well as be turned off again

	Constant checking mode can be described as every X seconds the main code triggers
	it scans the content of each directory and file and compares it to its subsiquent directory and file
	if it finds that one split is defferent from the others, it changes it to match
	if it finds more than one difference, it stops and gives a warning, and turns off checking
